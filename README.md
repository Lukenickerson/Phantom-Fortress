> You play the role of a Phantom Lord who has risen from the grave to command a small fortress. You can recruit minions, collect resources and expand your fortress - to a high tower or a deep catacomb. The game is mostly a sandbox simulation, meaning you can build your fortress however you'd like and there is no real end game.
